  "description": "You face an addon to Thaumcraft 4 and Botania, that adds tools and accesories, generally oriented on expansion of mid- and end-game content, offering you weapons of unmatched power. It all mostly goes to Thaumcraft side, but some relics are supposed to be a logical inheritors of Botania's things. There's also a variety of stuff inspired by and based on Terraria and Terraria's mods, especially Calamity and Thorium, even though it may not be very recognizable visually because of the freakin' copyright and all the pain in the ass that it brings.
This mod and everything it includes (except memes) is distributed under WTFPL license.",
